### Setup CODE CR1500 barcode reader
The script within this project enables the usage of control chars to navigate within a software. The script executed on the reader will check for placeholders as `<TAB>` or `<CR>` and replaces them with corresponding control chars.
The script can be extended to support further control keys or logic.
